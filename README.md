# ❤️ Heart Disease – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a heart disease dataset using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
The goal is to analyze clinical variables, visualize relationships, and extract insights that may help understand cardiovascular risk patterns.

## 📌 Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide.  
This project explores a heart disease dataset through interactive visualizations, enabling:

- Understanding distributions of clinical variables  
- Identifying relationships between age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other indicators  
- Supporting future feature engineering and predictive modeling  

The analysis is delivered as an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**, making the results accessible and easy to explore.
